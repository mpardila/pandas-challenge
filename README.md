# pandas-challenge

First, I wanted to clarify that I didn't use the starter code to better understand how much I know about Panda by starting with an empty jupyter notebook. I checked the starter code to confirm I was getting the same results.

I used the Xpert Learning Assistant to improve my code; for example, I searched for the syntax to format more than one column at a time.

During office hours, Mat helped me understand why a DataFrame I was sorting was getting unsorted afterward. The answer was very simple: I needed to save it in a new variable.

I did more than two conclusions, as it's important to get good at writing the results document as we are working on coding. I used the first section of the exercise to describe the database in general, and then I created a conclusion per section of the second part of the homework.

For the average score in math and reading per grade, I created additional sorted data frames to find which was the school with the highest average per grade per class.
