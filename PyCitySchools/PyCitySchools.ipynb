    "# PyCity Schools Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "- The database records information from 15 schools, with a total number of students of 39,170 and a district budget of $24,649,428.00. The district has an average score of 78.99 in math and 81.88 in reading. The percentage of students passing math is 74.98%, passing reading is 85.81%, and passing both subjects is 65.17%.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The 5 top schools in the district are charter schools. We can provide evidence that the percentage of students passing math and the percentage of students passing reading is above 90% (the percentage of students passing math from 93.27% for Thomas High School to 94.59% for Pena High School and the percentage of students passing reading from 95.95% for Pena High School to 97.31% for Thomas High School) which explains why they all rank among the highest-performing schools by Overall Passing percentage. The school with the highest Overall Passing percentage is Cabrera High School.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The 5 schools ranking at the bottom of the list are all district schools. Although they have a percentage of students passing reading above 80% (from 80.22% for Rodriguez High School to 81.32% for Huang High School), the percentage of students passing math is in the 65% to 67% range (from 65.68% for Huang High School to 66.75% for Hernandez High School) explaining why their Overall Passing percentage is in the 52% to 54% range. The school with the lowest Overall Passing percentage is Johnson High School.\n",
    "\n",
    "- When running the Math Scores by Grade, for 9th and 11th grade, the school with the highest score is Holden High School, for 10th grade Griffin High School, and for 12th grade Pena High School. When running the Reading Scores by Grade, for 9th and 11th grade, the school with the highest score is Shelton High School, for 10th grade Cabrera High School, and for 12th grade Holden High School. All schools ranked first by grade are charter schools, following the trend of the highest-performing schools by overall passing percentage.\n",
    "\n",
    "- From an Overall Passing percentage analysis based on the per-student spending categories, there is no evidence that the higher the spending, the better the Overall Passing percentage. The trend is the opposite: the schools with the lowest spending categories, less than $585 per student and $585 to$630 per student, have significantly better Overall Passing percentages, 90.37% and 81.42%, respectively. In the highest spend categories, $630 to $645 and $645 to $680, the Overall Passing percentages are 62.86% and 53.53%, respectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "- From a school size perspective, large schools with a number of students between 2000 and 5000 have the lowest Overall Passing percentage, with 58.28%.\n",
    "\n",
    "- From a school type perspective, the trend follows the analysis above as all charter schools have a significantly higher Overall Passing percentage of 90.43% compared to the district school type, where the Overall Passing percentage is only 53.67%\n",
